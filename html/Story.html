    <p style="font-size: 30px;">The spaceship sudddenly makes a loud bang and rattling sound. The whole space ship goes dark and the emergency lights kick on.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Hex opens up the control pannel and looks at the manual.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">OH NO! The buttons on the pannel are colorful, but the manual only displays hex codes.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">Hex knows that the first two digits in a hex code represent the amount of red, the next two are how much green, and the last two are how much blue.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px;">It is up to you to help Hex fix his ship and continue through space!</p>
    <buttons style="font-size: 30px;" type="button" onClick="window.location.href='/html/Story.html';">Click here to help!</button>
